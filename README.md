### Decaf Java

Prototype implementation of a drag-and-drop source code editor for Java.


#### Status

This is an archive of an entrepreneurial venture that ended in 2004. Our goal was to license DecafJava to software vendors who needed a generic plugin editor suitable for less technically experienced users. The dependency on a JVM and the clumsy JNI interface became significant obstacles, despite our efforts to provide a usable JNI layer. Successful products typically needed only a small interpreter compiled for the native platform that could be easily installed with the vendor's product, or even integrated directly.

#### Vision

Customizability is highly valued in certain kinds of applications, for example an email client that is used regularly, or a video editor where the user's entire project investment--time, talent, creative reflection--is summed up and carried by the editor's output files. But the cost and risk of developing flexible software has become such a strong deterrent that application design has been trending more and more towards the extremes of simplicity for over a decade. DecafJava was envisioned and built before this trend began, and the author is not surprised to see it unfold because it was well evident even in 2000 that the effort necessary to build a successfully customizable interface is rarely worth the benefit.
