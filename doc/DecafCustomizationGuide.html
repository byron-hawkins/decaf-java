<h2>Decaf Customization Guide</h2>

As mentioned throughout the documentation for this prototype, the Decaf editor can be 
customized in almost every way perceivable by the user.  The goal is to allow the application 
developer to control how the Java language appears.  This includes the following
<a href="DecafUserGuide.html#TypeChooser">Type Chooser</a> entities:
<dir>
<li>The types (i.e., Java classes) available in the type tree, and the names by which they are known
<li>The methods and fields available on those types
<li>Names of method parameters
<li>Descriptive instructions on the usage of each type, method, field and parameter
</dir>

Some users will require a great deal of very specific documentation, while others will just need a brief
mention of the purpose and functionality of each class and method.  <p>
The language constructs
themselves can also be tailored to the user base.  In some cases it is useful and feasible
to provide facilities for the complete Java language, including such technical features like
inner classes, interfaces and exception handling.  In other cases, a bare minimum of 
language constructs will suffice, and may even benefit the users if they are notably
unadventuresome.  The application developer chooses the visual component that represents
each language token and each editor role; these may be custom built as long as they implement
the appropriate interface and adhere to editor policy.  Typically the spectrum ranges from cumbersome 
but plainly obvious components on one end, to free flowing components that require a substantial 
grasp of software on the other.  Components for all of the language constructs can be plugged 
into the editor using the conifguration file decaf_config/umail/config.xml, the format for 
which is provided by <a href="config.dtd">config.dtd</a>.<p>

<a name="TypeChooser"/><h3>Type Chooser configuration</h3>
The contents of the type chooser are entirely determined by the aforementioned configuration file; they are 
drawn from the &lt;TypeDefinition&gt; and &lt;TypeChooserContent&gt; elements.  A type is
defined in the world of Decaf with a &lt;TypeDefinition&gt; element, which specifies its
classname by attribute.  By default, all of the declared methods of the class are available
for use in Decaf, but none of the superclass methods.  Use the attributes <b>declaredMethods</b>
and <b>superMethods</b> to change this behavior, using the value <b>DETAILED</b> to specify that only 
methods mentioned in the &lt;TypeDefinition&gt; element for that category should be available
in Decaf, or using the value <b>ALL</b> to specify that all methods should be made 
available whether they are mentioned in the &lt;TypeDefinition&gt; or not.  A method is mentioned
in detail with the &lt;Method&gt; element, which specifies its name by attribute and its parameters
with the sub-elements &lt;Parameter&gt;.  The term <i>detail</i> refers to the documentation that 
is attached to the nodes of the Type Chooser's type tree; that information is drawn from 
&lt;Discussion&gt; elements, which can optionally be applied to &lt;TypeDefinition&gt; and 
&lt;Method&gt; elements.  To detail a parameter or a field, simply include the documentation as the body
of the &lt;Parameter&gt; or &lt;Field&gt; element (respectively).
<p>
<h3>Type Chooser example</h3>
<dir>
<li>Open the file decaf_config/umail/config.xml in your favorite text editor and find the definition of 
the type List: <p>
&lt;TypeDefinition Classname="java.util.Vector" uid="List"&gt;<p>
Observe that it uses the default attribute 
for <b>superMethods</b>, which is <b>DETAILED</b>, meaning that only those
methods of Vector's superclasses that have been specifically detailed with &lt;Method&gt; 
elements will be available in for use in Decaf.  The useful method iterator() is therefore
excluded in this configuration; a Decaf user can't get a ListWalk object with which to walk 
the elements of (what they see as) a List.
<li>Add the iterator() method by creating a &lt;Method name="iterator"&gt; element
inside the &lt;TypeDefinition&gt; of List.  <p>
<li>Explain this method to the user by adding a &lt;Discussion&gt; element within the new &lt;Method&gt; 
element, and entering a user-level description in its body.  This description will appear at the bottom of the
Type Chooser when the node for the iterator() method is selected. <p>
<li>Open the Decaf editor to see how the method java.util.Vector.iterator() now appears to the user.

<a name="Return"><h3>Creating a Grammar</h3>
You may have noticed that, while the Decaf Method Editor has a return type field, there is no
means for creating a return statement.  For a technical discussion of the mechanism for creating
such a grammar, see the documentation for <a href="api/com/bitwise/decaf/editor/grammar/GrammarMask.html">GrammarMask</a>.
While you're here, let's try implementing this keyword by creating a new
subclass of GrammarMask named Return.  The easiest way is to copy the file 
decaf_demo/decaf/com/bitwise/decaf/editor/grammar/While.java to Return.java in that 
directory, and modify it (currently a do/while loop) to behave as a return statement.  If you just
want to see what the results look like, pay a visit to decaf_demo/example/Return.java
(perform the last step of these instructions to try it out).
<p>
<dir>
<li>Replace all instances of the whole word "While" with the word "Return".
<li>Remove the <code>PhraseBox "condition"</code> on lines 53-55 
<li>Change the <code>ParagraphBox "Do"</code> to a <code>PhraseBox "Return"</code> on line 56. 
<li>Rename the <code>static class ConditionOfficer</code> to <code>ValueOfficer</code>, becauase it
will now be monitoring the return value.
<li>Determine whether the current return value is in violation by checking it against the method's
return type with the following condition:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>data.getEnclosingMethod().getReturnType().isAssignableFrom(data.getType())</code><p> 
<li>If the return value is found to be in violation, we'll have to tell the user about it in the 
<code>super.violation()</code> statement.  Enter an appropriate violation message, using <code>Type.getDisplayName()</code>
to refer to the names of types.
<li>Modify the static class NewAction to present itself as a return statement; this class will be 
placed into the <a href="DecafUserGuide.html#GrammarMenu">grammar menu</a> when Decaf starts up. 
<li> Modify the static class Data to extend <a href="api/org/hs/generator/GReturn.html">GReturn</a> 
<li>Remove the <code>Paragraph body</code> member, and change the <code>protected ConditionOfficer</code> to
our <code>ValueOfficer</code>.
<li>Remove the middle three lines from the constructor. 
<fn>Note: The <code>handle</code> passed to the new Phrase in the <i>this</i> statement represents the paragraph 
(block of statements) in which the user has chosen to place this return statement.  The parameter
to the <a href="api/com/bitwise/decaf/editor/grammar/Sentence.html">Sentence</a> constructor that 
we added is its parent, and in this way we have attached the new return statement into the Decaf
code tree.</fn>
<li>Our ValueOfficer needs to patrol the return value; instantiate the officer prior to the line <code>handle.setData(this)</code>,
to be sure that the officer exists before being called.
<li>Put the officer on duty after the line <code>handle.setData(this)</code>, using the statement:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>((Phrase)super.value).patrol(officer);</code><p>
<li>Return to (original) line 56 for a moment, and change the reference to <code>this.data.body</code>
to <code>this.data.value</code>, so that the mask displays the return statement value.  
<li>Using the existing <code>Data.getComponent()</code> method as an example (understanding that
<code>super.description</code> refers to the description field available on every Decaf grammar),
modify it to present the <code>Data</code> class as a return statement.  Use <code>Phrase.render()</code> 
to render the value of the return statement.  
<li>Modify the <code>Data.setHandle()</code> method to set the handle of the <code>super.value</code> 
field to the parameter <code>handle</code> (as demonstrated in the example).  This method is called when the 
user moves this return statement to a different location in the code tree, so we must notify our internal 
construct of our change of address.  
<li>Edit the file config.xml and add a &lt;Sentence&gt; entry in the &lt;Grammars&gt; element with the 
new return grammar com.bitwise.decaf.editor.grammar.Return.  This notifies Decaf to load our return statement 
into the grammar menu at startup. 
</dir>
<p>
The next time you run Decaf, you will have the opportunity to return values from your methods.  But lookout,
if a return value is declared in a method, then a return statement is required as the last statement of the 
method body.  Are your users up to this?  If not, consider the following option.
<p>
<h3>Customizing the Method Editor</h3>
Suppose that your user base is remarkably unwilling to deal with grammatical concerns in their plugins, but
are happy to use a very restrictive editor.  The implementation of the return statement <a href="#Return">above</a>
will probably annoy them, because they will frequently forget (as I always do) to return a value at the very
end of the method body.  Instead, considser replacing the <i>Return Type</i> field in the Method Editor with a 
<i>Return Value</i> field.  The user will simply put the method's return value (an expression) in this field.  A corresponding
return statement will be added at the end of the method body, and the type of the return expression will be applied 
as the return type of the method.  An example implementation can 
be found at <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decaf_demo/example/ReturnValueBox.java.<p>
Add this file to the directory decaf_demo/decaf/com/bitwise/decaf/editor/grammar, compile it, and register the
class with decaf by changing the entry for &lt;EditorConfig&gt;&lt;MethodComponents&gt;&lt;ReturnComponent&gt;
to use <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;classname&gt;com.bitwise.decaf.editor.grammar.ReturnValueBox&lt;/classname&gt;<p>
Ideally, of course, the
lowest common denominator of the return value's type will need to be applied as the method return type, but this
implementation will suffice for a simple demonstration.
