<h2>The Business Proposal</h2>
I am seeking an established software development company to assist me in the completion 
of the Decaf project.  Ideally, this company will have an immediate application for the 
Decaf editor and its plugins.  The details of the arrangment are flexible; please consider
the following.
<p>
<dir>
<li>Formal agreement to purchase a redistribution license of Decaf upon its initial release.
<li>Formal partnership tasked with the distribution of Decaf and its integration into other
companies' applications on a consulting basis.  There is potential for a vertical market here.
<li>Arrangement of sponsorship for my continued development of Decaf for release under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Library Gnu Public License</a>.
</dir> 
Please also consider any modifications to and combinations of the above terms, and feel free to 
suggest any that would be agreeable to your company.  Simply put, I am open to any options that 
are compatible with my priorities for the project, as follows.
<p>
<dir>
<li>Create the very nicest product in Decaf, making it fun and well appreciated by as many of 
its users as possible.
<li>Establish Decaf Java internationally as the primary programming tool for the "non-programmer".
<li>Maintain either partial ownership of Decaf, or royalty rights to its distribution (unless
arrangements are made for its distribution under the LGPL).

<a name="WorkRemaining"/><h3>Work Remaining</h3>
Decaf requires the following structural modifications for a promotion to <a href="Glossary.html#alpha">alpha</a> 
status.  When Decaf reaches the alpha stage, all further development will interstingly fall under the category of
customization.  The process of filling out the editor and type chooser with a full complement of language
constructs and <a href="Glossary.html#JavaAPI">Java API</a> classes must be done on the basis of the needs
of a specific group of users.  It is for this reason that I approach your business with the Decaf project
at such an early stage of development.  In a matter of three or four months, I will begin to implement 
customer-specific features.  So I am asking you to decide now whether you would like your customer base to 
be included in my initial implementation list when that time arrives.

<dir>
<li>Decaf is currently integrated into the open-source Java compiler <a href="Glossary.html#KJC">KJC</a>, which
	must be replaced for the following reasons:
<dir>
	<li>KJC is distributed under the GNU General Public License, which of course affects my 
		<a href="#License">license options</a>.
	<li>Built as a command-line compiler, KJC is not structurally suited for compilation of 
		code constructs generated in realtime.  <br>
</dir>
	More suitable compilers with commercially compatible open-source licenses have been identified.<p>
<li>I plan to extend the internal compiler's rule checking classes such that:
<dir>
	<li>They can be thrown as exceptions into the Decaf editor 
	<li>Each is equipped to display a configurable, user-level explanation of the compile error
</dir><p>
<li>Some Java language features need a home in the Decaf editor framework, including:
<dir>
	<li>Facilities for the display and correlation of multiple user-defined classes 
	<li>Recognition of a single class' implementation of multiple interfaces in the 
		<a href="DecafUserGuide.html#TypeChooser">TypeChooser</a>
</dir><p>
<li>The object model within the Decaf user interface is not presently cohesive, nor can it be until
	some of the above features are implemented.  Once accomplished, the scope of this object model will 
	become concisely definable, and the task of completing its design will be simple.<p>
<li>Decaf needs a special classloader that watches directories of user plugins for modification and 
	automatically reloads each new compilation as it arrives on disk.<p>
<li>A visual tool for the construction of dialogs will be very important for novice Decaf users.  While I 
	have yet to design the tool, I imagine it will be a combination of <a href="api/org/hs/jfc/HotComponent.html">
	HotComponent</a> and a layout manager such as <a href="jdk/api/javax/swing/SpringLayout.html">SpringLayout</a>.<p>
<li>A class import feature will be added to the <a href="DecafUserGuide.html#TypeChooser">Type Chooser</a> such that
	it will allow the user to import any Java class they would like to incorporate into their project.  <p>
<li>Decaf currently stores its .cup files using Java's <a href="jdk/api/java/io/Serializable.html">Serialization</a>
	mechanism, which produces enormous files, and is exceedingly fragile: it refuses to open a particular file if any of the 
	class definitions for objects in the file have been modified since the file was stored.  There are some small 
	leniencies to this problem, but Decaf really must have its own binary file format.

<a name="License"/><h3>License</h3>
You may have noticed that this prototype is covered by the very restrictive 
<a href="License.html">GNU Public License</a>, which does not allow this Decaf prototype or
any descendant of it to be integrated into or used by a commercial application.  Future versions 
of Decaf will be sold commercially under a different license.  My reasons for temporarily using 
the GPL are:
<p>
<dir>
<li>To allow myself to distribute the complete source code of the prototype, for potential 
partner companies' review, without jeopardizing my rights to it.<br>
<li>To allow this prototype of Decaf to be developed and integrated into GPL products. <br>
<li>To maintain an obligation to compiler <a href="Glossary.html#KJC">KJC</a>, which Decaf uses 
to generate .java source files and byte code.  KJC is covered under the GPL, and therefore this version
of Decaf must also be.  I have identified other compilers bearing more lenient, commercially
compatible licenses; these compilers are also of much higher quality.  It will be a simple (but 
laborious) task to integrate one of these compilers into Decaf.
