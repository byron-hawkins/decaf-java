<h2>uMail User's Guide</h2>
The Decaf prototype can be demonstrated in action with the native C++ application uMail, 
"the mail client that does what you want".  Run uMail from a command prompt in its home
directory decaf_demo/umail.  At the login prompt, type any user name you like; your account
will be created if it does not already exist.  The application is basic and self-explanatory:
select menu items by number, and enter information when prompted for it.  When you send an email message, uMail
will look in its account list for the recipient you have addressed; if not found, uMail will
create an account with that address as its username upon delivering the message.  Log in to a recipient's account
to view messages that have arrived there.  Note that the default implementation of the 
system function <b>Send Mail</b> (located from the main menu at <b>View Plugins</b>><b>System 
Operations</b>><b>Send Mail</b>) delivers a copy of the message to the sender's <b>Sent Items</b> message folder.
<p>
<h3>uMail plugins</h3>
In a column to the right of the 
menu options you will see a list of names in &lt;angle brackets&gt;.  Each name corresponds to 
the Java class (a plugin) that currently implements the menu item to its left.  As 
indicated at the prompt, you may edit any plugin by entering its menu item number followed
by the letter <b>e</b>; in this way, uMail can be made to do what you want.  uMail will tell you the 
name of the plugin method for the operation you have selected at the command prompt
while it opens Decaf with the specified class file.  If the plugin method does not exist in that class, Decaf
will create an empty method with the appropriate name and signature.  
<p>
<b>Why C++?</b><br>
You won't have to look at uMail
very long to see that it could be entirely implemented in Decaf plugins.  But imagine for a moment that 
instead of uMail, this demonstration were based on your favorite email client.  These plugin methods
could remain the same, regardless of what that client is, because the user interactions facilities are
part of the main application and passed to the plugin as abstract entities.  Classes such as Prompt, 
DataDisplay and MessageInput can be implemented with text, or graphics, or anything else.  uMail simply
demonstrates the principle of plugins, even though they are not essentially distinct in its particular case.
<p>
<b>Plugin files</b><br>
Behind the scenes, Decaf has been 
instructed by its uMail-specific configuration to use the package name <b>com.bitwise.umail</b> for all its 
plugin classes.  When you open the default plugin class &lt;uMailPlugins&gt;, Decaf looks
in the directory <b>decaf_demo/decaf/com/bitwise/umail</b> for the file named uMailPlugins.cup.  This
file compiles into the class <b>com.bitwise.umail.uMailPlugins</b>, which goes by the shortened alias
uMailPlugins in uMail.  Note that it takes especially long to open
the Decaf editor the first time in a particular uMail session; thereafter it is much faster.  
<p>
<h3>User customization of uMail</h3>
Beyond the simple process of editing uMail's <a href="Glossary.html#IntrinsicAccessibility">intrinsically defined</a> 
plugins, a uMail user is also given opportunity to add plugins to the system in certain places.  This section gives
general instructions for adding plugins to uMail in this way.  Please refer to the <a href="DecafUserGuide.html">
Decaf User's Guide</a> for information on getting around the Decaf editor.  More detailed step-by-step instructions for adding
features to uMail at the user level are provided by the <a href="DecafTutorial.html">Decaf Tutorial</a>.  <p>

<b>Adding a standalone plugin</b><br>
<dir>
<li>Log in to uMail and choose option <b>3) View Plugins</b>, then <b>2) Plugins</b> to see the list of user-invoked
plugins currently available.  This menu was itself created by a plugin, as we are about to see.
<li>Choose option <b>Done</b> to move up to the <b>View Plugins</b> menu, and see that (in the default case)
the Java class &lt;uMailPlugins&gt; is responsible for creating the plugin menu.
<li>Enter <b>2e</b> to edit &lt;uMailPlugins&gt;; uMail explains that the method in action here is named <b>getPluginMenu()</b>.
<li>Double-click the method <b>getPluginMenu()</b> and read the instructions at the top of the <b>Method Editor</b>
for adding plugins to this menu.
<li>Open the <a href="DecafUserGuide.html#TypeChooser">Type Chooser</a> with ctrl-T and see the type <b>Plugins</b>
in the <b>uMail</b> category for instructions on creating a plugin menu item.
<li>Note that the <b>Plugin</b> type represents the Java class com.bitwise.uMail.jMenuOption, which is implemented
by the uMail class <a href="api/c++/jMail.html#jMenuOption">jMenuOption</a>.
<li>Return to uMail and choose <b>2) Plugins</b> again to view the plugins menu.  Notice that a separate Java class is 
assigned to each plugin in the menu; one class can define a plugin, while another implements it.
<li>Note that the plugin menu is created by a call to <b>getPluginMenu()</b> every time it is displayed, so that
context-specific provisions may be made; for example, certain plugins might only be valid for certain days of the week,
and would otherwise not be displayed.  
</dir>
<p>
<b>Adding a folder menu plugin</b><br>
Plugins may be added to the folder menu in a similar way.  The folder menu is constructed by the plugin method
named <b>getFolderMenu()</b>; its assignment can be seen next to the <b>View Mail</b> menu option, and also appears
next to the name of every folder menu item in the tree of mail folders.  Edit the plugin from any of these locations, 
and double-click the method <b>getFolderMenu()</b>; further instructions for adding items to the folder menu will 
appear at the top of the <b>Method Editor</b>.
<p>
Notice that if you browse mail folders, the message menu items don't show the arrival time of the message.  You have
to read the message to find out when it arrived.  What a nuisance!  What can we do about this?  Since we have access 
to everyone's account, log in to <b>zak</b>'s account to see how he displays the number of items in each folder next 
to its entry in the folder menu.  In the real world, we would of course have to ask Zak for a copy of his <b>getFolderMenu()</b>
method, or at least for his expertise in adding features in it.  Edit the folder menu plugin with <b>2e</b> from the 
main menu, and double-click <b>getFolderMenu()</b> to see Zak's fancy 
<p>
<h3>Developer customization of uMail</h3>
If you experiment with uMail and its plugins for very long, you will notice that there are enough features 
missing from the Decaf editor and the uMail API to make your work a little difficult.  I encourage
you to explore the <a href="NativeIntegration.html">Native Integration</a>, the
<a href="config.dtd">Configuration DTD</a> and the 
<a href="DecafCustomizationGuide.html">Decaf Customization Guide</a> for information on adding 
features to Decaf and uMail, and customizing existing features.  You may even be interested in implementing 
one or two new features yourself, just to see what is involved.  For example, it is currently awkward to 
implement a "Move" menu item in the folder menu.  Why is that?  What is required to make this feature more easily 
available to a uMail user?
<p>
*<fn>Note that plugins are not reloaded by uMail after they have been edited.  You will need to exit uMail
and start it again to see modifications to your plugins.  This nuisance will of course be vanquished in the production
version of Decaf.
