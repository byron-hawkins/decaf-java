<a name="IntrinsicAccessibility"/>
<dt>Intrinsic Accessibility</a>
<dd>By implementing customizable application objects with plugins (insofar as they can be customized),
the developer maximizes accessibility while minimizing development effort.  See this principle
<a href="TheHype.html#IntrinsicAccessibility">preached</a>&nbsp;and <a href="NativeIntegration.html#IntrinsicAccessibility">
practiced</a>.
<p>

<a name="MinimalDrift"/>
<dt>Minimal Drift
<dd>In any development environment, the user will be required at times to <i>drift</i> away from the task at hand in pursuit
of some information that is necessary for their progress.  I take the effectiveness of a development environment 
to be a direct measure of the frequency of these interruptions, the number of steps required to be taken away from the 
editor, and the potential for getting lost at each step.  See the minimization of drift <a href="DecafUserGuide.html#MinimalDrift">
practiced</a> and <a href="TheHype.html#MinimalDrift">preached</a>.

<a name="JavaAPI"/>
<dt><a href="jdk/api/index.html" target="outer">Java API</a>
<dd>The Java API contains almost the entire set of facilities provided by a <a href="#JRE">Java Runtime Environment</a>.  
Only its primitive types are treated as langauge constructs, and even those have handles in the API.  
<p>

<a name="JRE"/>
<dt><b>J</b>ava <b>R</b>untime <b>E</b>nvironment
<dd>The JRE contains the <a href="#JVM">Java Virtual Machine</a> and a copy of the class library that comprises the 
<a href="#JavaAPI">Java API</a>.  Its <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">download</a> is about 10MB,
and it is available for commercial <a href="jdk/J2RE_License.html#Redistribution">redistribution</a>. 
<p>

<a name="JVM"/>
<dt><b>J</b>ava <b>V</b>irtual <b>M</b>achine
<dd>The JVM is the binary executable in which the Java language runs.  It may be <a href="api/c++/plugin.html#jVM">loaded</a>
in the address space of any application, which may then <a href="api/c++/plugin.html#Plugin">call methods</a> on Java object 
instances in that companion JVM.  A member of the family Suidae, the JVM is weighty and uncompromising in its use of
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/install-windows.html#requirements">system resources</a>.  
<p>

<a name="JNI"/>
<dt><b>J</b>ava <b>N</b>ative <b>I</b>nterface
<dd>Java was not originally designed to run in conjunction with other platform-specific code.  When the need arose, the
keyword <code>native</code> was added to the language to refer to methods implemented in another language.
Such implementations can only be accessed by Java when exported from a dynamic library.  The <a href="#JRE">JRE</a> comes 
with a static library jvm.lib that provides C methods to instantiate and run the <a href="#JVM">JVM</a>, and along with 
various (usually cumbersome) means of interacting with it.  The JNI is discussed (somewhat vaguely) in the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/native1.1/index.html"> Java Tutorial</a>.  While the JNI is not the most 
elegant aspect of Java, it does in fact provide sufficient means for integrating Java with native code -- it's just a 
hassle to work with it.  See the source code for the static library <a href="api/c++/index.html#plugin">plugin.o</a>
for an example of what is required.
<p>

<a name="GarbageCollector"/>
<dt>Garbage Collector
<dd>When the reference count on a Java object goes to zero, the <a href="#JVM">JVM</a> marks it as disposable,
such that a system process known as the garbage collector will eventually locate the object and free its
memory.  One of the hassles of Java is that the garbage collector is neither efficient nor accurate; if 
memory is at a premium and plugins are run repeatedly, Decaf will have to include some mechanism for dumping
the JVM and reloading a new instance of it.  
<p>

<a name="KJC"/>
<dt>KJC</dt>
<dd>An open-source Java compiler from the <a href="http://www.dms.at/kopi">Kopi project</a>, which is covered under the 
GNU General Public License.  
<p>

<a name="Jacks"/>
<dt><a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/cvs/jikes/~checkout~/jacks/jacks.html">Jacks</a>
<dd>This hip and masculine term refers to a compiler regression test from IBM that verifies the degree
to which a compiler conforms to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/jTOC.doc.html">
Java Language Specification</a>.  If a compiler has "passed" Jacks, it definitively maintains each and 
every requirement of the JLS.  
<p>

<a name="bytecode"/>
<dt>Bytecode
<dd>The term <i>bytecode</i> refers to a stream of bytes that is understood by the physical processor of a computer.  
Java source files are compiled into Java <i>bytecode</i>, which is interpreted by the <a href="#JVM">Java Virtual
Machine</a> when the code is executed or referenced.  Java bytecode differs from pure (processor-specific) bytecode
in that it has been abstracted to run on a number of processors: Intel (PC), Alpha (PC), Motorola (Mac), SPARC (Unix), 
AIX (Unix), etc., and it requires the <a href="#JVM">JVM</a> to translate it into pure bytecode as it runs.  
<p>

<a name="3GL"/>
<dt>Third <b>G</b>eneration <b>L</b>anguage
<dd>The term <i>3GL</i> refers to programming languages that are compiled, maintain strict rules about data types, and
usually provide substantial structure.  They are known as the <i>third</i> generation because they compile into assembly
language constructs (the <i>second</i> generation), which are further compiled into some variety of <a href="#bytecode">
bytecode</a> (the <i>first</i> generation).  Common examples are Java, C and C++.  
<p>

<a name="4GL"/>
<dt>Fourth <b>G</b>eneration <b>L</b>anguage
<dd>The term <i>4GL</i> refers to programming languages that either compile into a <a href="#3GL">3GL</a>, or that are
tranlated into <a href="#bytecode">bytecode</a> as they run (the latter are known as scripting languages).
<p>

<a name="token"/>
<dt>Token
<dd>The term <i>token</i> is used by compilers to refer to a set of characters delimited by whitespace (i.e., space, tab, and newline)
and/or structural characters (i.e., semicolon, parenthese, quotation mark, comma, etc.).  Simply put, a token is a "word" of source
code.  In Java, a token represents either a language keyword, a class name or member of a class (i.e., a field, method, or inner class).
<p>

<a name="parse"/>
<dt>Parse
<dd>The first step in compiling a file of source code is to <i>parse</i> the file, identifying each <a href="#token">token</a>
as a language keyword, a reference to a data structure, or unknown (i.e., a parse error).
<p>

<p>
<a name="alpha"/>
<dt>Alpha
<dd>An <i>alpha</i> model of a software product in development exhibits the fundamental object model of the finished
product, but lacks implementation of features within that framework, and is typically full of glitches, errors, hassles, 
<font size=-1>undefined conditions, hang points, unexpected behaviors, </font><font size=-2>display discrepancies, inconsistent 
responses, incomprehensible user messages</font> ... that is to say, bugs.
