<h2>Welcome</h2>

The Decaf Java development environment provides self-declared non-programmers with
access the entire Java programming language, including its vast <a href="Glossary.html#JavaAPI">class library</a>.  
Decaf's point-and-click user interface assists the user in creating syntatically and functionally correct code, 
and its visual components map to Java code constructs on a one-to-one basis, so as to avoid cohesion problems.
The UI is fully <a href="DecafCustomizationGuide.html">customizable</a>, allowing the application developer to 
assemble a version of Decaf that specifially suits the expected needs and skill level of 
any particular group of users.  While it can be used as a standalone development environment, Decaf has been 
organized primarily for the creation of plugins that customize and automate commercial applications.
It should be a simple and non-intrusive process to <a href="NativeIntegration.html">
integrate</a> Decaf into any application.  And it should be an experience of creative
freedom and <a href="Glossary.html#MinimalDrift">unfettered productivity</a> for 
users to implement their imagination with the Decaf editor.
<p>
<h3>What this prototype demonstrates</h3>
The Decaf editor currently implements most of the object model intended for its initial production version, and the 
user experience of that finished model can be effectively interpolated from this prototype (some imagination required).
I recommend getting started with a trial run of the demo application uMail, as narrated 
by the <a href="uMailUserGuide.html">uMail User's Guide</a>.  While it may appear primitive 
(it runs on the command line, after all),
uMail demonstrates a progressive concept called 
<a href="Glossary.html#IntrinsicAccessibility">intrinsic accessibility</a>,
which maximizes user options for customization while minimizing the user interface
code of the application.  A complete <a href="DecafTutorial.html">tutorial</a> takes you step-by-step through
the process of writing code in Decaf, and the end-user process of customizing uMail features.  The 
<a href="api/c++/index.html">source code</a> for 
uMail has been made available, so that you may see an example of integrating Decaf
into an application.
Take a look at the <a href="api/index.html" target="outer">Decaf API Documentation</a> for an 
understanding of its composition.  If you feel ready to try customizing the editor, follow the instructions
in the Decaf Customization Guide for <a href="DecafCustomizationGuide.html#Return">
implementing the return statement</a>.
<p>
<h3>What this prototype does not demonstrate</h3>
I am currently inviting corporate participation in the Decaf project; see the 
<a href="BusinessProposal.html">business proposal</a> for details.  Because that could 
result in a wide variety of implementation contexts, I have included in this prototype 
only those features that cannot be found in typical industry applications, or validated by 
a trivial analysis.  Among the missing features is a visual editor for the creation of 
dialogs; this is demonstrated by numerous Java IDE's, such as Visual Age for Java from IBM,
Borland JBuilder, and Symantec Visual Cafe.  Another is that the native integration library 
<a href="api/c++/index.html#plugin">plugin.o</a>
does not currently reload plugins after they have been edited by the user.  Implementing this feature is 
a small hassle in Java, but not difficult; it is a requirement of servlet and JSP engines.  Compile errors in Decaf will in 
the future be presented to the user by the 
very same Java compiler class that detected the error.  This requires too much effort for
a prototype, but take a look at the <a href="api/org/hs/generator/package-summary.html">
org.hs.generator</a> package to see how it can be done effectively without a great deal of 
tumult in the internal workings of the compiler.
