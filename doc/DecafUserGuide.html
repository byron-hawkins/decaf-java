<h3>The Basics</h3>
The Decaf editor provides a point-and-click interface for the entire Java programming language (though this prototype
is actually <a href="#NotEntirely">missing a few features</a>).  You will not be able to type in code, which may seem
cumbersome at first, but it should quickly become second nature to build your Java program using the visual components
of the editor.  For use with uMail, Decaf has been configured with a small
set of common code constructs, and allows only one class at a time to be edited.  The name of the current class appears at
the top of the <b>Class Editor</b>, and will be used as a filename upon saving (this is a Java requirement).  The package name
will also be chosen as "com.bitwise.umail" for simplicity, though multiple packages are of course possible in Decaf.
The remaining components are mostly self-explanatory.  Create a field, method or parameter with the attached
<b>New</b> button.  Give it a name by keyboard, and <a href="#HotPick">hot-drop</a> a type on it from the 
<a href="#TypeChooser">Type Chooser</a>.  Use the right mouse button to popup the <a href="#GrammarMenu">grammar menu</a>
in the method body, and create a statement by selecting one of the items.  From here (the method body) on in, code 
constructs are created with the grammar menu.  To reference a variable in an expression, hot-select the variable at its
point of declaration (including local variables inside statement blocks) and hot-drop it on the expression in question.
<p>
<h3>Rule Enforcement</h3>
Decaf enforces a number of constraints by disallowing the <a href="#HotPut">hot drop</a> of code components in places that 
will guarantee an
error.  For example, variables cannot be referenced in expression boxes that are out of their scope.  Try it: create
an assignment statement, and below it declare a variable.  Hot-select the variable and mouse over the assignment editor.
Notice that neither of the expression boxes will highlight; they have checked up the line and failed to find the 
variable in their scope, and so have rejected it.  Another example is the condition of an 'if' statement, which will
only accept boolean variables.  If you hoodwink one into taking a non-boolean expression, perhaps by inserting a method call that 
returns another type, the 'if' statement will turn blue.  It's got the blues because it knows this non-boolean 
expression will fail to compile.  Open the <a href="#BluesReview">Blues Review</a> with ctrl-B to see the sad statement, and click
on it for an explanation.  If you're interested, check out the documentation for 
<a href="api/com/bitwise/decaf/editor/grammar/EnforcementOfficer.html">EnforcementOfficer</a> to see how Java rules
are enforced in the editor.  
<p>
<a name="MinimalDrift"/><h3>Minimal Drift</h3>
Decaf implements its UI rules and features on the basis of the principle <a href="Glossary.html#MinimalDrift">minimal drift</a>, 
which states that the usefulness of 
an IDE can be judged by the frequency and distance the user must travel away from the task at hand to figure
out how to make something in the editor work.  In the case of Decaf, this especially includes the rules of the Java language,
and the details of the class library.  For example, suppose a uMail user wants to display message delivery times in the
folder browser (see the <a href="uMailUserGuide.html">uMail User's Guide</a> for context).  Suppose also that the user sees 
how to get the <b>sentTime</b> from a message, but does not know how to format a <a href="jdk/api/java/util/Date.html">Date</a> 
object.  To figure this out, the user must drift away from
the <b>Member Chooser</b> and go to the <b>Type Chooser</b> to explore the methods available on the Date object.  
This configuration of Decaf provides the
method <a href="api/c++/uMail_i.html#jTime">format()</a>, complete with explanation, and quickly the user is back to work 
coding their plugin.  But have you ever tried to format a Date in Java without such a documented convenience method?  You'll 
drift all the way to the package java.text before you can get any kind of text string out of a Date object -- and the 
<a href="Glossary.html#JavaAPI">Java API</a> documentation won't tell you very much about it.  You'll probably have to find a chat room, 
or a Java-savvy friend, to find out 
how java.text applies to your message folders.  Decaf can be <a href="DecafCustomizationGuide.html">configured</a>
to help even when convenience methods like format() have not been implemented by the application developer.  A comment attached
to the <a href="DecafCustomizationGuide.html#TypeChooser">Type Chooser</a> node for java.util.Date can suggest to the user
the various mechanisms available to extract formatted text strings from a Date object.  The user will in this case need to
"drift off" into the javadoc for information about various java.util and java.text classes.  Decaf does not claim to 
reign in the drift on all sides (certainly this prototype does not), but I hope you'll agree it offers a great deal of 
relief to the user who is more interested in getting their plugin to work than they are in tinkering, reading and yakking.
See the <a href="NativeIntegration.html">Native Integration</a> documentation for the corollary to <i>minimal drift</i> known 
as <a href="Glossary.html#IntrinsicAccessibility">intrinsic accessibility</a>.  
<p>
<a name="NotEntirely"/><h3>...some things are missing</h3>
While not all of the 
language constructs are implemented in this prototype, the foundation on which they can be built has been completed.
See the <a href="DecafCustomizationGuide.html#Return">Decaf Customization Guide</a> and the class 
<a href="api/com/bitwise/decaf/editor/grammar/GrammarMask.html">GrammarMask</a> for instructions on 
creating editor facilities.  In most cases
it is not desirable to have all the language features available, because they are not always useful.  For example,
in the context of uMail, a user would rarely miss the ability to create static methods, and their presence in the editor would only 
increase the potential for confusion: "What is all this stuff?".  On the other hand, it would be nice if users could
create an interface to represent a FolderMenuContent object (a folder or a message), but this feature is presently missing.

<p>
<a name="TypeChooser"/><h3>Type Chooser</h3>
The class library available to Decaf is listed in the Type Chooser's type tree (ctrl-T to open).  Types in the tree may
be <a href="#HotPick">hot-selected</a>; this is the primary means of declaring the types of objects.  At the bottom of its window
is a text display of documentation for each class, method and parameter; it shows information relevant to the currently
selected node (if there is any).  The contents of this window are taken from the Decaf Configuration File (found at 
decaf_demo/umail/config.xml).  Double-click a node to open the <a href="Glossary.html#JavaAPI">Java API</a> (javadoc generated) 
<a href="jdk/api/index.html" target="outer">documentation</a> for the specified entity.  

<p>
<a name="BluesReview"/><h3>Blues Review</h3>
The Blues Review contains a list of statements and expressions in the current file that are syntactically or otherwise incorrect 
(ctrl-B to open).  Click on an item 
in the list, and Decaf will consecutively open each editor from the corresponding method body down to the offending construct
(it always jumps a bit here -- sorry).
A box will appear in the upper-left corner of the screen explaining why this bit of code "has the blues" (click anywhere in
this window to close it).  You'll notice that the text of the code construct itself is blue until it is happy about its place
in the world.

<p>
<a name="Percolator"/><h3>Percolator</h3>
Statements and expressions that are deleted or displaced in the process of editing a file are not vaporized, 
but instead appear quietly in the Percolator (ctrl-P to open).
Any percolating item can be returned to service by hot-dropping it back into your plugin.  The Percolator makes for a handy
clipboard when cutting and pasting numerous items.
Statements are grouped into fragments if deleted in multiple, and are always labeled "Fragment#" with an incrementing 
index.  Open a fragment (by double-clicking or pressing enter) to give it a better
name for future reference.

<p>
<a name="HotPick"/><h3>Hot Selection</h3>
The user creates associations between editor components using the <a href="api/org/hs/jfc/HotComponent.html">HotComponent</a> interface.  
Here's
how it works: hot-select an item with alt--left-click.  If hot-selectable, the item will turn red (so you won't lose track of what's
been selected).  Now mouse around the editor and see that certain components highlight with a red border as you pass by.  These are
potential <a href="#HotPut">drop</a> locations.

<p>
<a name="HotPut"/><h3>Hot Drop</h3>
(continued from <a href="#HotPick">Hot Selection</a>)<br>Drop a hot-selected item onto a component with alt--right-click.  The drop site
must already be highlighted, indicating that it is willing to accept the hot-selected item; if it is not highlighted, the drop site
is saying that it's not compatible with the hot-selected item, and nothing will happen if you try to drop there.  The rules for 
determining what internal data object gets delivered in a hot drop can be somewhat complex, and are detailed in the 
<a href="api/org/hs/jfc/HotComponent.html">HotComponent
API documentation</a>.  One or both components may choose to ask for more details about your intentions before any data is
dropped (but none will do so in the current Decaf editor).    

<p>
<a name="GrammarMenu"/><h3>Grammar Menu</h3>
This menu can be popped up on any component that contains code constructs (right-button to pop); these begin at the method 
body and include all sub-components of it.  Code components represent either a block of statements or a single (possibly
compound) expression.  If popped on a statement block, the grammar menu will contain a list of grammars suitable for creating 
statements.  Selecting one 
will cause the associated construct to be created and inserted at the click location, and an editor opened with its (empty)
contents.  If popped on an expression box, the grammar menu will contain expression grammars.  If the expression box is not
empty, then the menu item selected will have to decide what to do with the present contents.  
If they are compatible with the construct
being created (e.g., if of the same code construct), they may be used as its initial contents.
If not used, they will be sent to the <a href="#Percolator">Pecolator</a>.  In either case, the new expression will then be 
inserted into the box, and an editor opened with its contents.  This <a href="DecafCustomizationGuide.html#Return">configuration</a> 
of Decaf provides the following grammars.<p>
<b>Statement Grammars</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Declare a Variable

<a name="Open"/><h3>Open Button</h3>
Use this button to find and open a file.  

<p>
<a name="Save"/><h3>Save Button</h3>
This button saves the current file in a binary .cup format, which includes the current contents of the <a href="#BluesReview">Blues
Review</a> and the <a href="#Percolator">Percolator</a>.  It does not also compile the current file, so you'll have to use the compile button 
specifically, if that's what you have in mind.

<p>
<a name="Compile"/><h3>Compile Button</h3>
This button prints a .java file containing all the code in the current plugin, and compiles that file in a separate process using 
decaf_demo/bin/jikes (the popular <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/">Jikes</a>, from IBM).  
Originally, the foundation package <a href="Glossary.html#KJC">at.dms.kjc</a> was responsible for directly
compiling the Decaf code constructs (without printing .java first), but due to some small bugs in its vast sea of code,
I've abandoned KJC for the time being (I currently use it only for printing Decaf constructs to .java code).   The compile button 
does not also save the current file, so you'll have to use the save button specifically, if that's what you have in mind.
