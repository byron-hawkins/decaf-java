<body>
This package contains the foundation of the Decaf editor, including
all user interface components for code constructs up to but 
excluding the contents of method bodies (those are found in the 
grammar package).  All components and their presentation to the user
are configurable through modification of the configuration file 
config.xml (see config.dtd in the com.bitwise.decaf.editor.config
directory), and the attachment of custom components to editor 
dialogs.  This package contains some facilities that are used by 
the grammar package, and it is only those classes that are being
documented here.
