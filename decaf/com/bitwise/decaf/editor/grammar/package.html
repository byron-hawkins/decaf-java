This package contains the user interface foundation for the contents
of method bodies.  To avoid confusion with the base package {@link org.hs.generator},
I've chosen the aliases {@link Phrase} for Expression, {@link Sentence} for Statement, and
{@link Paragraph} for Block.  This package adds one layer to the source tree of
a typical {@link GSourceFile}: each node contained in a method {@link GMethod.body} is wrapped in 
one of the aforementioned aliases, which act as placeholders for the code
structure as constructs are created, modified and removed.  These aliases
extend the abstract base class {@link CodeNode}, and they each route the code 
generation calls encodeExpression() and encodeStatement() to the {@link GConstruct}
they contain.  Code constructs should always be displayed in their 
respective components {@link PhraseBox}, and {@link ParagraphBox}.  The 
{@link Grammar} constructs Phrase and Sentence are equipped to be monitored by 
{@link Officer} instances, which validate code correctness as it is entered.  When
an {@link EnforcementOfficer} (subclass of Officer) finds error in a grammar, it sets 
that grammar's 'blue' property
to true, which automatically places the offending line into the 
{@link Blues Review}, available for the user's analysis 
when they are ready.
