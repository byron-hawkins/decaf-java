This package contains alternatives to some of the cumbersome facilities
of the JFC.  HotComponent serves the same purpose as drag and drop,
but is substantially less processor intensive, easier to code, and allows
the user to use their mouse buttons while choosing and navigating to the
drop location.  FormLayout organizes standard input components into rows
and columns in a predictable, intuitive, and easily coded manner.  The 
package is available free for your use, modification, and redistribution,
though it remains under the copyright of HawkinsSoftware (1999,2003).
